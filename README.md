## Usage
- Use `npm install` to install dependencies. Google Chrome may be required.
- Run `node create-account.js --keys=5` to create 5 keys.
- Keys are stored in `keys.txt` by default.

Obviously I can't stop you, but don't go crazy making 10000 keys. When they inevitably mass-disable everything, it won't matter how many back-up keys you have, so generate a few keys at a time as needed.
